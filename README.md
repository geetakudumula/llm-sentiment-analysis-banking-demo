# 🧠 LLM-Based Sentiment Analysis for Banking Feedback

> Real-time customer sentiment classification using Hugging Face Transformers (BERT) — tailored for a banking style feedback analysis use case.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world banking feedback sentiment analyzer** using a pretrained BERT model via Hugging Face Transformers. Customer comments, such as those collected from chatbot interactions or online surveys  are processed and classified as **positive** or **negative**.

🔍 **Primary Goal**: Help banks gauge customer satisfaction at scale using AI/LLMs.

> ⚠️ _Note: This is a fictional demonstration inspired by enterprise banking use cases and is not affiliated with any specific financial institution._
